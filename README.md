# Assignment: Python

Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to write a Python program that generates the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence without using any custom functions.


Instructions:

Write a Python program that generates and prints the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence without defining custom functions. Implement this program using loops.

Ensure that the program can handle edge cases, such as when N is less than or equal to 0.

Use loops to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. You can choose to use a for loop or a while loop.

Example:
```python
 Input: N = 5
 Expected Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
```
